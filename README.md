# Advanced-Econometrics-with-R
This project demonstrates the application of advanced econometric techniques to address complex data challenges such as endogeneity, non-stationarity, and heteroscedasticity. While basic models assume ideal conditions, this analysis focuses on robust estimation methods used in professional economic research.
